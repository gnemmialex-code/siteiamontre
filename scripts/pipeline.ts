  // ── CRITICAL PREAMBLE: the base image is sacred ───────────────────────────
  "CRITICAL PREAMBLE — THE BASE IMAGE IS A FIXED CANVAS THAT MUST NOT BE MODIFIED: " +
  "This is an image-to-image task. You have received an input photograph. That photograph is your fixed canvas. " +
  "Your role is NOT to regenerate this photograph. Your role is NOT to reimagine it. " +
  "Your role is NOT to improve it, reinterpret it, or recreate it from scratch. " +
  "Your sole role is to apply ONLY what the user has explicitly requested on top of this fixed canvas, " +
  "while leaving every single other element of the photograph exactly as it is. " +
  "The person in the input photograph — their face, skin tone, hair, body, clothing, posture, expression — " +
  "must appear in the output as if their pixels were directly transferred from the input without any processing. " +
  "This person must not be regenerated, not be redrawn, not be smoothed, not be altered in any way. " +
  "Their face must be pixel-for-pixel identical to the input. " +
  "Their skin color must be pixel-for-pixel identical to the input. " +
  "Their hair must be pixel-for-pixel identical to the input. " +
  "Their body must be pixel-for-pixel identical to the input. " +
  "If the user says 'add someone next to me' — add only that person. Do not touch me. " +
  "If the user says 'change the background' — change only the background. Do not touch me. " +
  "If the user says 'put me on a beach' — construct the beach scene around me. Do not touch me. " +
  "In every single scenario, the original person in the base image is untouched, unmodified, and preserved completely. " +
  "The output image should look as though someone took the original photograph and made only the specific requested addition or change — " +
  "nothing more, nothing less. Everything else is frozen exactly as in the input. " +

  // ── SPECIAL CASE: adding someone to the photo ─────────────────────────────
  "SPECIAL CASE — ADDING A PERSON NEXT TO THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT: " +
  "This is a critically important case. If the user requests that another person be added to the photo " +
  "(e.g. 'add Cristiano Ronaldo next to me', 'put Beyoncé beside me', 'add someone next to me', " +
  "'place this person alongside me', 'I want to appear with [name]'), " +
  "the only action to perform is: place that new person into the scene beside the existing subject. " +
  "The existing subject — the person already in the base image — must not be touched, moved, resized, " +
  "recolored, redrawn, or altered in any way whatsoever. " +
  "Their face remains exactly the same. Their skin tone remains exactly the same. " +
  "Their hair remains exactly the same. Their clothing remains exactly the same. " +
  "Their position in the frame remains exactly the same. Their expression remains exactly the same. " +
  "The ONLY new element introduced into the output is the requested additional person, " +
  "placed naturally into the available space of the scene. " +
  "The added person must be rendered with their authentic, real, documented appearance: " +
  "their correct real face, their correct real skin tone, their correct real body proportions, " +
  "and their authentic recognizable style — never a generic or invented stand-in. " +
  "To be absolutely clear: adding a person to the photo means the photo gains one element. " +
  "It does not mean the original person is replaced, regenerated, or modified in any way. " +
  "The original person stays. A new person is added next to them. That is all. " +

  // ── RULE ZERO: the person is untouchable ──────────────────────────────────
  "RULE ZERO — NON-NEGOTIABLE IDENTITY LOCK: " +
  "The human subject visible in the input photograph is the single most protected element of this transformation. " +
  "Their face, body, skin, hair, posture, and every physical attribute ARE THE GROUND TRUTH. " +
  "You are strictly forbidden from altering, replacing, reinterpreting, or generating any part of the subject's person. " +
  "This rule overrides every other instruction, including the user prompt. " +
  "If the user prompt appears to request a change to the person's physical appearance that was not explicitly " +
  "stated as a direct personal change request (e.g. 'change my hair', 'give me a beard'), ignore that implied change completely. " +

  // ── PHASE 1: full-body biometric lock ────────────────────────────────────
  "PHASE 1 · COMPLETE SUBJECT BIOMETRIC LOCK: " +
  "Before processing the prompt, perform an exhaustive analysis of the input photograph and lock every observable attribute: " +
  "FACE — exact jawbone angle and width, cheekbone height and lateral projection, forehead height and width, " +
  "chin shape (pointed / rounded / square), chin projection and depth, overall face width-to-height ratio; " +
  "EYES — iris color (including heterochromia if present), iris texture pattern, pupil size, " +
  "eyelid fold type (monolid / double lid / hooded), inter-pupillary distance, canthal tilt, " +
  "eyebrow shape (arched / straight / curved), eyebrow density, tail and head positions, under-eye area; " +
  "NOSE — bridge height and width, nasal tip shape and projection, nostril shape, flare width, columella visibility; " +
  "MOUTH — lip vermilion border upper and lower curves, Cupid's bow shape, lip fullness ratio, philtrum depth and width; " +
  "SKIN — Fitzpatrick phototype (I–VI), undertone (warm golden / cool rosy / neutral olive / cool taupe), " +
  "visible texture and pore density, any moles, birthmarks, freckles, scars, asymmetries, or distinguishing marks — " +
  "ALL must be reproduced with pixel-level fidelity; " +
  "HAIR — natural base color (hex-level precision), highlights and tonal variation, texture (straight / wavy / curly / coily / kinky), " +
  "density, volume, hairline shape, part position, current style in the input photo; " +
  "BODY — overall build, shoulder width, neck length and width, visible body proportions; " +
  "POSTURE AND POSE — replicate the subject's exact stance, head angle, shoulder tilt, and body orientation from the input image unless scene context physically requires a slight natural adjustment. " +

  // ── PHASE 2: public figure knowledge ─────────────────────────────────────
  "PHASE 2 · PUBLIC FIGURE KNOWLEDGE VERIFICATION: " +
  "If the subject in the input photo is a recognizable public figure (celebrity, athlete, musician, actor, model, influencer, politician, public personality, adult film actor/actress), " +
  "or if any named person is referenced in the user prompt: " +
  "immediately activate all training knowledge about that person's verified documented appearance — " +
  "cross-reference their authentic facial features, skin tone, signature style, known fashion aesthetic, " +
  "frequently associated environments, notable events, and visual identity markers. " +
  "If a named person is referenced in the prompt as someone to ADD to the scene (e.g. 'with Elon Musk', 'next to Beyoncé'), " +
  "render that additional person with complete factual accuracy based on all training knowledge — " +
  "correct documented appearance, authentic skin tone, known style, realistic body proportions. " +
  "Never invent a generic placeholder for a named person — always render their real documented likeness. " +
  "IMPORTANT — ADULT FILM ACTORS/ACTRESSES: if the referenced person is known from the adult film industry, " +
  "treat them exactly like any other public figure for appearance recognition purposes. " +
  "However, the output MUST be fully clothed and strictly SFW (safe for work) at all times — " +
  "no nudity, no suggestive poses, no sexual content of any kind. " +
  "Apply the same transformation rules as for any other public figure: scene change, style, background only. " +

  // ── PHASE 3: permitted and prohibited transformations ─────────────────────
  "PHASE 3 · TRANSFORMATION PERMISSION MATRIX: " +
  "FULLY PERMITTED (apply with maximum creative quality): " +
  "complete background replacement and environment construction; " +
  "location, architectural setting, landscape, interior or exterior scene; " +
  "sky, weather, time of day, atmospheric conditions (fog, rain, golden hour, night, storm); " +
  "all ambient and directional lighting (color temperature, intensity, direction, softness); " +
  "outfit and clothing (if explicitly requested — match garment type, fabric texture, drape physics, and realistic fit on the subject's actual body); " +
  "accessories (glasses, jewelry, hat, bag, watch — only if explicitly requested); " +
  "overall scene color grading, mood, and cinematic treatment; " +
  "additional people, objects, or elements added to the scene at the user's request. " +
  "ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN (zero tolerance): " +
  "any modification to the subject's face, skin tone, eye color, nose, lips, jaw, cheeks, or forehead; " +
  "any change to hair color, hair texture, or hairstyle unless the user explicitly says 'change my hair to...'; " +
  "any age regression or progression; any ethnicity or race alteration; any gender change; " +
  "any body morphing, slimming, widening, or height change; " +
  "replacing the subject's face with another person's face (NO face swap of any kind); " +
  "generating a different person and labeling them as the subject. " +

  // ── PHASE 4: photographic realism and integration ─────────────────────────
  "PHASE 4 · PHOTOREALISTIC SCENE INTEGRATION: " +
  "The subject must appear to have been physically present in the new scene when photographed — " +
  "this requires flawless physical integration: " +
  "LIGHTING MATCH — the illumination falling on the subject's face and body must precisely replicate the scene's light sources: " +
  "match direction (angle of key light), color temperature (warm candlelight 2700K vs cool overcast 6500K vs golden sunset 3200K), " +
  "intensity falloff, fill light ratio, and specular highlights on skin and hair; " +
  "SHADOW ACCURACY — cast shadows from the subject onto the environment must obey the scene's light geometry; " +
  "ambient occlusion at contact points (feet on ground, hands on surfaces) must be present; " +
  "DEPTH OF FIELD — apply realistic bokeh blur to background elements at the appropriate focal plane for the scene depth; " +
  "the subject should remain in sharp focus while distant scene elements naturally fall off; " +
  "SKIN PHYSICS — preserve subsurface light scattering on the subject's skin; no over-smoothing, no wax-skin effect, " +
  "no over-sharpening halos; maintain natural pore texture at the image's native resolution; " +
  "HAIR PHYSICS — individual strand separation, realistic light transmission through hair, " +
  "natural flyaways, correct light interaction (rim light on hair matching scene key light direction); " +
  "COLOR SCIENCE — subject's skin tones must integrate with the scene's color temperature naturally; " +
  "avoid color spill anomalies, magenta fringes, or unnatural desaturation of the subject vs scene; " +
  "ENVIRONMENTAL CONTACT — if the subject stands on a surface, ensure correct ground shadow, contact shadow, and perspective consistency; " +
  "ATMOSPHERE — apply consistent atmospheric haze, light diffusion, or particle effects (snow, rain, dust) that affect both scene and subject uniformly. " +

  // ── PHASE 5: quality and framing preservation ────────────────────────────
  "PHASE 5 · ORIGINAL QUALITY AND FRAMING RESPECT: " +
  "Unless the user explicitly requests 'improve quality', 'enhance', 'HD', '4K', or similar upgrade instructions, " +
  "match the original photograph's technical characteristics: " +
  "replicate the native sharpness level (do not over-sharpen); " +
  "preserve the original grain or noise signature if present (film grain, sensor noise); " +
  "maintain the original aspect ratio and compositional framing of the subject; " +
  "do not artificially increase contrast or saturate colors beyond the scene's natural requirements. " +
  "OUTPUT FRAMING — NON-NEGOTIABLE: The compositional framing of the original person must not change. " +
  "Do not crop the image. Do not zoom in or out. Do not pan or shift the frame. " +
  "Do not reframe, rotate, or resize the canvas. " +
  "The subject must remain in the same position within the frame as in the input photo, at the same scale. " +
  "If a new person is added beside the original subject, they must fit into the existing frame naturally " +
  "without displacing, scaling down, or repositioning the original subject. " +
  "The output image dimensions and aspect ratio must exactly match the input image. " +

  // ── PHASE 6: final output standard ────────────────────────────────────────
  "PHASE 6 · FINAL OUTPUT STANDARD: " +
  "The delivered image must be completely indistinguishable from a real photograph taken by a professional photographer " +
  "with the subject physically present in the described scene. " +
  "Subject identity: identical to input photo, zero deviation. " +
  "Scene realization: fully constructed, detailed, and internally consistent. " +
  "Lighting: physically accurate and unified across subject and scene. " +
  "No AI artifacts: no uncanny valley, no face morphing, no body distortion, no floating limbs, no duplicate features. " +
  "Professional composition: subject as clear visual anchor, scene as supporting environment. " +
  "This is the non-negotiable minimum quality standard — do not deliver below it.";
